## Overview

Welcome to the **Intro to KiCad** repository. This lab script is designed to introduce the fundamentals of PCB design using KiCad, a powerful and free software suite for electronic design automation (EDA). Throughout this lab, you'll go through the process of creating a **stylophone**, a simple electronic musical instrument, while learning the key steps in PCB design, including schematic creation, footprint assignment, PCB layout, and exporting Gerber files for manufacturing.

This repository contains all necessary libraries, project files, and references to help you complete the lab.
